                            <p>Our flagship course helps high school students thrive in their future academic endeavors by providing hands-on instruction covering the fundamentals of quantitative analysis and reasoning.</p>

                            <h3>Course Description</h3>
                            <p>Data analysis has become a staple feature of modern society. Questions related to public policy, private business, charity work and international NGO's all increasingly rely on data to make informed decisions. To have access to high quality data and to analyze it correctly, however, are two different things. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the basics of data science using econometric techniques and machine learning. Econometrics is a subfield of economics that applies statistical methods to data in order test economic relationships, theories and ideas. Often, it is used to distinguish <i>causation</i> from <i>correlation</i>. In this course, we will cover the basics of linear regression as a first step to establishing causal relations between different observed phenomena, economic or otherwise.</p>

                            <h3>Format and Structure</h3>
                            <p>This course has three parts.</p>
                            <p>The first part includes an introduction to the basics of econometric analysis and machine learning. It covers such topics as linear regression, hypothesis testing, non-linear relationships, dummy variables and panel data.</p>
                            <p>The second part of this course is focused on applied data science. It provides students with an opportunity to apply the concepts in lecture in order to develop real-world data skills. Each week there is a data tutorial in which students will be given a real-world dataset to analyze. Students start with basics - plotting trends, distributions, scatterplots - and work up to linear regression and panel data methods. Students will learn coding skills in Python.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in the third part, students will produce an empirical research paper, either on a topic of their choosing or a topic assigned by the lecturer. The paper is meant to be 10 to 15 pages. The aim is to write something suitable to be published in an undergraduate or high school journal. In the past, students have written on such subjects as the gender-wage gap, racial differences in AI-exposure, as well as the factors that determine entry into elite private colleges. </p>
